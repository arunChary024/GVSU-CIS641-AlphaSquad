## Prerequisites

### Before using the LSTM Text Generation Tool, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Google Colab Account: You should have an active Google Colab account. Google Colab provides free access to cloud-based Jupyter notebooks, making it an excellent environment for running Python code, including deep learning tasks.
- Access to a GPU (Optional): While not mandatory, having access to a GPU can significantly accelerate the training of deep learning models. Google Colab offers GPU support, and you can enable it in your Colab notebook settings.
- Deep Learning Framework: Install the necessary deep learning framework TensorFlow for Python, which is required for running the LSTM-based text generation model. You can install TensorFlow using pip within your Colab notebook:
pip install tensorflow
- Additional Python Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries and dependencies by running the following commands:
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install os
pip install time
- Training Data: Depending on your use case, you may need a corpus or dataset. Ensure that you have access to the training data and that it is compatible with the Google Colab environment.
